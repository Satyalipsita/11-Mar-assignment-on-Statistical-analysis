    "Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to calculate conditional probabilities. \n",
    "It states that the probability of an event A occurring, given that event B has occurred,\n",
    "is equal to the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred,\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose a certain medical test for a rare disease has a 5% false positive rate\n",
    "(meaning that it falsely identifies 5% of healthy people as having the disease) \n",
    "and a 2% false negative rate (meaning that it falsely identifies 2% of people \n",
    "with the disease as not having it). Suppose also that the disease occurs in 0.1% of the population.\n",

    "Now, suppose a patient tests positive for the disease. \n",

    "Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease) / P(Positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result,\n",
    "P(Positive|Disease) is the probability of testing positive given that the patient has the disease, \n",
    "which is 1 - false negative rate = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98,\n",
    "P(Disease) is the prior probability of having the disease, which is 0.001,\n",
    "P(Positive) is the probability of testing positive, which is the sum\n",
    "of the probability of a true positive and the probability of a false positive:\n",
    "    P(Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease) + P(Positive|No Disease) * P(No Disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Positive|No Disease) is the false positive rate, which is 0.05\n",
    "P(No Disease) is the complement of the disease rate, which is 1 - P(Disease) = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, P(Positive) = 0.98 * 0.001 + 0.05 * 0.999 = 0.05094\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in these values, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) = 0.98 * 0.001 / 0.05094 = 0.0192\n",

    "Therefore, the probability that the patient actually has\n",
    "the disease given a positive test result is approximately 1.9%.\n",
