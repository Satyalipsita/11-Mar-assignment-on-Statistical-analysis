    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter\n",
    "with a certain level of confidence. \n",
    "It is a way to estimate an unknown population parameter based on a sample from that population.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to estimate the mean height of all \n",
    "people in a certain country, but it is not practical to measure the\n",
    "height of every person in the country. So, we take a random sample of 100 people and measure their heights. We can use this sample to calculate a confidence interval for the population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to calculate a confidence interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the level of confidence: The most common levels of \n",
    "confidence are 90%, 95%, and 99%. For this example, let's use a 95% level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the sample mean: Add up all the heights in \n",
    "the sample and divide by the number of people in the sample (in this case, 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the standard deviation of the sample: This tells us how spread out the heights \n",
    "are in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the standard error of the mean: This takes into account both the sample size\n",
    "and the standard deviation of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the critical value: This is based on the level of confidence and the \n",
    "degrees of freedom (n-1). For a 95% level of confidence and 99 degrees of freedom\n",
    "(100-1), the critical value is 1.984.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the margin of error: This is the product of the critical\n",
    "value and the standard error of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the confidence interval: Subtract the margin of error from \n",
    "the sample mean to get the lower bound of the interval, and add the \n",
    "margin of error to the sample mean to get the upper bound of the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say the sample mean height is 170 cm and the standard\n",
    "deviation of the sample is 5 cm. The standard error of the mean is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard error of the mean = standard deviation / square root of sample size\n",
    "Standard error of the mean = 5 / square root of 100\n",
    "Standard error of the mean = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical value for a 95% level of confidence and 99 degrees of freedom is 1.984.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin of error = critical value * standard error of the mean\n",
    "Margin of error = 1.984 * 0.5\n",
    "Margin of error = 0.992\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower bound = sample mean - margin of error\n",
    "Lower bound = 170 - 0.992\n",
    "Lower bound = 169.008\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper bound = sample mean + margin of error\n",
    "Upper bound = 170 + 0.992\n",
    "Upper bound = 170.992\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can say with 95% confidence that the true population mean\n",
    "height falls within the range of 169.008 cm to 170.992 cm."
