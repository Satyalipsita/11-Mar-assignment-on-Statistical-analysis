    "To calculate the z-score for the sample mean,\n",
    "we can use the following formula:\n",

    "z = (X̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, \n",

    "Interpretation: The z-score of 1 means that the\n",
    "sample mean is one standard deviation above the\n",
    "population mean. This indicates that the sample is \n",
    "relatively larger than the population mean. \n",
    "The z-score can be used to calculate the \n",
    "of observing a sample mean as large or larger t\n",
    "han the one observed, assuming that the population\n",
    "mean and standard deviation are accurate. We can also use \n",
    "the z-score to compare the sample mean to other samples \n",
    "taken from the same population or to compare samples taken from different populations."
